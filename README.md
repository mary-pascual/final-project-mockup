# final-project-mockup

(Side note: For my final project mockup, my group decided to try to do the Flea Market idea from the list of final projects.  I think that the hardest part for me was trying to get everything to work the way I wanted it to, but most of them are probably due to the inconsistant variable names that I give them (ex. I always forget if I called something Item or Items).  However, I believe my mockup has a good general idea of what I wanted the app to accomplish even though this version is a very rough draft.  After sharing ideas with my group, I'm confident that I'll be able to make the mockup into a nicer version of what the app is supposed to do.)

This app was created in order for UH Manoa students to post the things they want to sell. The people interested press the 'request' button to show to other users that the item is on hold for someone, who will contact the seller. In order to gain access to this website, users will need to log in with their UH email and password. They can then add or edit items to sell and create their own profile for others to see.

## Home Page

When the user reaches the page, they are expected to log in using their UH email and password. Once they log in, they will reach the screen as shown in the picture below. From there, they can pick from four different pages of what they desire to do.

## Add Item

On the add item page, users can input the information of the item they desire to sell. Once they click submit, they'll be taken back to the home page. However, the item they input will go to the list of items page.
